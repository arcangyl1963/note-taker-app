## Installation:<br>

My files can be accessed in the repository [HERE](https://github.com/arcangyl1963/note-taker-app)<br>

The image below shows the repository where my project files are located:

![Note Taker App Repository](./public/assets/images/note-taker-app_gitrepo.png)

Install the application by cloning the repo from the link above or by downloading the files to your local drive.

The repository will contain all of the files needed to run the application:

* A 'db' directory containing the JSON database file where the notes are stored.
* A 'public' directory containing the assets directory and the two HTML files for the main landing page and the notes app page.
  * The 'assets' directory contains directories for images, CSS, and Javascript files.
    * The 'js' directory contains the index.js script file.
* A 'routes' directory containing the script files for the api and view routes.
* A 'tests' directory containing the four test scripts for each class.
* A package.json file that contains the dependencies required for the application to run and the testing script path.
* An server.js script file that is invoked in NodeJS to run the application.

First begin by installing any dependencies required to run the application and to setup the development environment on your local repository.<br>

In Terminal or a similar bash command-line utility, navigate to the working directory and enter:<br>

~~~
npm install OR npm i
~~~

This will install any package dependencies defined in the package.json file.
Once the required packages have been installed, the application can be launched.

## Usage:<br>
To run the application locally type the following into Terminal or the command-line utility of your choice:

~~~
node server.js
~~~

The application can be accessed at http;//localhost:8080.

## Deployed-app:

The Heroku deployed application can be accessed at the link below:

The application loads first to a main landing page shown below. Clicking the 'Get Started' button loads the note taking panel for the application.<br>

The right side of the note panel contains the title entry field and the note text entry field where the user enters the note information. The left side displays the list of saved notes.

When the user enters a title and the note text into the text area, a Save icon will display next to the New Note icon.

Clicking the Save icon will save the note to the database file and the note will display in the left-side note list.
